As a population cannot be studied as a whole, samples are drawn from it and the statistical findings of the sample are then projected to the whole population.

The sampling error is a statistical error that represents the difference between a sampleâ€™s statistics from the population parameters.
For example, the mean weight of a sample can be 70 kg. This will differ from the mean weight of the entire population. This difference is the Sampling error.
