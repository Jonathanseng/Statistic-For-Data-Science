Remember the Z-score formula that contained μ (mean of the
population) and σ (the standard deviation of the population)?
When the population’s standard deviation is not known (but estimated) and the sample size is small, one uses t-score instead of Z-score.

t-score and z-scores are similar when the sample size is large but this is not true for small sample size.

where:
!" X is the observation’s value
!" μ is the sample mean
!" s is the estimated standard error of the population
The estimated Standard Error is calculated by dividing a

sample standard error by the square root of the sample size.
