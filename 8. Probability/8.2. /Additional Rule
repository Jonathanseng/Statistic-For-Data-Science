1. If two events are mutually exclusive, the probability of a particular event occurring is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities.

2. For example, in a set of cards of 4 colors, the probability of picking a red card is 1/4 = 0.25 and the probability of picking a green card is 1/4 = 0.25 .
The probability of picking a red OR green card is 1/4 + 1/4 = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 .
