# Here's an example of Python code that demonstrates the application of the additional rule of probability in statistics, specifically the addition rule:

# Addition rule for mutually exclusive events
def addition_rule_mutually_exclusive(prob_a, prob_b):
    # Calculate the probability of either event A or event B occurring
    prob_a_or_b = prob_a + prob_b
    return prob_a_or_b

# Addition rule for non-mutually exclusive events
def addition_rule_non_mutually_exclusive(prob_a, prob_b, prob_a_and_b):
    # Calculate the probability of either event A or event B occurring
    prob_a_or_b = prob_a + prob_b - prob_a_and_b
    return prob_a_or_b

# Example usage
prob_a = 0.4  # Probability of event A
prob_b = 0.3  # Probability of event B
prob_a_and_b = 0.1  # Probability of both event A and event B occurring

# Calculate the probability of either event A or event B occurring (mutually exclusive)
result_mutually_exclusive = addition_rule_mutually_exclusive(prob_a, prob_b)
print("Probability of either event A or event B occurring (mutually exclusive):", result_mutually_exclusive)

# Calculate the probability of either event A or event B occurring (non-mutually exclusive)
result_non_mutually_exclusive = addition_rule_non_mutually_exclusive(prob_a, prob_b, prob_a_and_b)
print("Probability of either event A or event B occurring (non-mutually exclusive):", result_non_mutually_exclusive)

# In this code, the addition_rule_mutually_exclusive function calculates the probability of either event A or event B occurring when the events are mutually exclusive. The addition_rule_non_mutually_exclusive function calculates the probability of either event A or event B occurring when the events are not mutually exclusive. The probabilities of events A and B, along with the probability of their intersection (both A and B occurring), are provided as input to the functions. The calculated probabilities are then printed as output.

# You can modify the probabilities (prob_a, prob_b, prob_a_and_b) to match your specific scenario and observe the results.
