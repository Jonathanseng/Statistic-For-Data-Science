The multiplication rule of probability in statistics is used to calculate the probability of the intersection or joint occurrence of two or more events. It allows us to determine the probability of multiple events happening simultaneously.

The multiplication rule is applied in two different scenarios: when the events are independent and when the events are dependent.

Multiplication Rule for Independent Events:
If two events are independent, the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other. In this case, the multiplication rule states that the probability of both events occurring is equal to the product of their individual probabilities.
Mathematically, if A and B are independent events, the probability of both events occurring is calculated as:
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)

For example, let's say we have a fair coin and a fair six-sided die. We want to calculate the probability of getting a head on the coin (event A) and rolling a 4 on the die (event B). Since these events are independent, we can calculate the probability as:
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B) = 1/2 × 1/6 = 1/12

Multiplication Rule for Dependent Events:
If two events are dependent, the occurrence of one event affects the probability of the other event. In this case, the multiplication rule considers the conditional probability of the second event given that the first event has occurred.
Mathematically, if A and B are dependent events, the probability of both events occurring is calculated as:
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B|A)

Here, P(B|A) represents the conditional probability of event B given that event A has occurred.

For example, consider drawing two cards from a standard deck of 52 cards without replacement. We want to calculate the probability of drawing a heart on the first draw (event A) and drawing a heart on the second draw (event B). Since the events are dependent (without replacement), we can calculate the probability as:
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B|A) = 13/52 × 12/51 = 1/17

The multiplication rule is fundamental in probability calculations and is used in various statistical applications, including genetics, epidemiology, machine learning, and decision analysis. It helps quantify the likelihood of multiple events occurring together, taking into account their dependencies or independence.
