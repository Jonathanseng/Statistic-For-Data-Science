The Probability ( p ) of an event is the ratio of the number of likely outcomes to the number of all outcomes.

1. It lies between 0 (no chance of the event occurring) and 1 (absolute certainty of the event’s occurrence).

2. The probability of an event not occurring ( q ) is 1 — p where p is the probability of the event occurring
