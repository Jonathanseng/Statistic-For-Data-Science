The Standard deviation (σ) of a dataset is the square root of the variance.
A high standard deviation means that the observations are spread out over a wider range.

For a normally distributed dataset, the following are true:
1. ~68% of the dataset lies within ±1 standard deviation of the mean
2. ~95% of the dataset lies within ±2 standard deviations of the mean
3. ~99.7% of the dataset lies within ±3 standard deviations of the mean

To revise, let us consider the following dataset:
2,4,4,4,5,5,7,9

Its mean can be calculated as:
 The square deviation scores are calculated as:
 The Variance is calculated as:
 Finally, the Standard deviation is calculated as :
