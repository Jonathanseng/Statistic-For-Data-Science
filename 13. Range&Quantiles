Range is the difference between the largest and smallest values of measurements in a dataset.
For example, in a dataset i.e. 1,2,4,3,67 , the range is 67 â€” 1 = 66.
Quantiles are points that divide the range of a dataset into continuous intervals of equal class intervals.
Some common quantiles divide the dataset into the following groups:

1. Quartiles: 4 groups

2. Quintiles: 5 groups

3. Deciles: 10 groups !"Percentiles/ Centiles: 100 groups
