It is a measure of whether the dataset is heavy-tailed or light- tailed as compared to a normal distribution.
It tells whether there are a large number of outliers/ extreme values in a dataset.
For a dataset with observations i.e. Y(1), Y(2),Y(3),...,Y(N) , the kurtosis is calculated as:

where:
!" Y Ì„ is the mean
!" s is the standard deviation
!" N is the number of observations
The kurtosis for a standard normal distribution is 3 .
