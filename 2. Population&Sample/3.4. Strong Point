In statistics, a strong point of a sample refers to its characteristic or feature that is particularly advantageous or valuable for drawing meaningful conclusions about the population from which it is drawn. Here are a few strong points of a sample in statistics:

Representativeness: A strong sample is representative of the population it is intended to represent. It accurately reflects the key characteristics and diversity of the population in terms of relevant variables. A representative sample increases the generalizability of the findings to the larger population.

Randomization: Random sampling is a strong point in statistics. It ensures that every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample, reducing bias and increasing the likelihood of obtaining an unbiased estimate of the population parameters.

Adequate sample size: A strong sample has a sufficient number of observations to provide reliable estimates. Adequate sample size helps to reduce sampling error and increase the precision of statistical inferences. Larger samples generally provide more accurate results.

Low sampling error: Sampling error refers to the discrepancy between the sample statistic and the population parameter. A strong sample minimizes sampling error by being representative, random, and large enough. A low sampling error indicates that the sample is a good approximation of the population.

High reliability and validity: A strong sample is obtained using reliable and valid measurement techniques. Reliability refers to the consistency and stability of the measurements, while validity refers to the accuracy and appropriateness of the measurements in capturing the desired constructs or variables.

Low non-response bias: Non-response bias occurs when individuals selected for the sample do not respond to the survey or study. A strong sample minimizes non-response bias by employing effective methods to encourage participation and by analyzing and accounting for non-response patterns.

It's important to note that these strong points are not exhaustive, and the strength of a sample depends on the specific research objectives, context, and methods used.
