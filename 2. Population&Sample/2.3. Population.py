# To calculate basic statistics for a given population in Python, you can use the numpy library. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to calculate mean, standard deviation, and variance for a population using Python:

import numpy as np

# Define the population data
population = [10, 15, 12, 18, 20, 14, 16, 19, 13, 11]

# Calculate the mean
mean = np.mean(population)
print("Mean:", mean)

# Calculate the standard deviation
std_dev = np.std(population)
print("Standard Deviation:", std_dev)

# Calculate the variance
variance = np.var(population)
print("Variance:", variance)

# In this code, we first import the numpy library as np. Then, we define the population list containing the data values of the population.

#We use the np.mean() function to calculate the mean (average) of the population. The np.std() function calculates the standard deviation, and the np.var() function calculates the variance of the population.

#Finally, we print out the calculated mean, standard deviation, and variance.

#Make sure you have the numpy library installed in your Python environment before running this code. You can install it using pip install numpy.
