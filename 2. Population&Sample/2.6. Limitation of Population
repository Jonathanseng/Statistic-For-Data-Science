Although using the population in statistics has its advantages, it also has certain limitations that should be considered. Here are some of the limitations of population in statistics:

Time and Cost: Collecting data from an entire population can be time-consuming and expensive. It may involve extensive efforts to reach and gather data from every individual or element in the population. This can pose practical constraints, especially when dealing with large populations or limited resources.

Feasibility: In some cases, it may be impossible to access or measure the entire population. For example, when studying historical events or inaccessible populations, complete data collection may not be feasible. This limitation can hinder the direct use of the population in statistical analysis.

Variability and Heterogeneity: Populations can be diverse and exhibit significant variability across different characteristics. When working with the entire population, it can be challenging to capture and account for this heterogeneity in statistical analysis. It may be more manageable to focus on specific subgroups or utilize sampling techniques.

Time Dependency: Population characteristics can change over time due to various factors such as demographic shifts, social changes, or evolving behaviors. If population data is not up-to-date or fails to capture these changes, the conclusions drawn from population analysis may not accurately reflect the current state of the population.

Data Quality: The quality of data within a population can vary. It is essential to ensure that the data collected from the entire population is accurate, reliable, and free from errors. However, it can be challenging to achieve this, particularly if data collection methods are not standardized or subject to biases.

Practical Constraints: Analyzing the entire population may be impractical or unnecessary for certain research questions. In many cases, a well-designed representative sample can provide adequate information and reliable estimates of population parameters. Using a sample can be more efficient and cost-effective.

Inference Limitations: While population data allows for direct estimation of population parameters, it may not provide insights into causal relationships or allow for strong causal inference. For causal analysis or hypothesis testing, experimental designs or other study designs are often required.

It's important to consider these limitations when deciding whether to work with the entire population or a sample. Each research question and context may require different approaches, balancing the advantages and disadvantages of using population data in statistical analysis.
