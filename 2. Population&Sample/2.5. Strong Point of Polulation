Using the population in statistics offers several strengths and advantages. Here are some of the strong points of population in statistics:

Accuracy: When data is collected from the entire population, there is no sampling error involved. The results obtained from analyzing the complete population data are considered to be highly accurate and representative of the entire population. This is particularly beneficial when precision is crucial or when small differences in the data are important.

Generalizability: Since the population represents the entire group of interest, conclusions drawn from analyzing population data can be directly generalized to the entire population. This allows for robust and reliable inferences about the entire target population, without the need to make assumptions or adjustments for sampling bias.

Detailed Analysis: Working with the population enables researchers to conduct detailed analyses and explore various characteristics and subgroups within the population. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of the population and can uncover insights that may be missed in smaller samples.

Population Parameters: Population data provides a precise estimate of population parameters, such as the mean, standard deviation, proportion, or correlation. These parameters can be directly calculated without relying on statistical inference or estimation techniques.

Small Subgroup Analysis: When dealing with small subgroups or rare occurrences within a population, analyzing the entire population can provide more accurate and reliable information. Small groups or rare events may be underrepresented or not captured adequately in a sample, but examining the entire population ensures their inclusion.

Longitudinal Studies: In longitudinal studies where data is collected from the same individuals over an extended period, working with the entire population allows for accurate tracking of changes and trends over time. This provides a comprehensive understanding of the population dynamics and facilitates the study of long-term effects.

Policy and Decision Making: Population data is often essential for making informed decisions and formulating policies. Decision-makers can rely on accurate population statistics to understand the needs, preferences, and characteristics of the entire population, thereby enabling more effective planning and resource allocation.

While using the entire population offers notable advantages, it's important to consider practical limitations and constraints, such as time, cost, and accessibility. In many cases, working with a representative sample may be more feasible and appropriate. Nonetheless, the use of population data can provide valuable insights, particularly in situations where accuracy and generalizability are of utmost importance.
