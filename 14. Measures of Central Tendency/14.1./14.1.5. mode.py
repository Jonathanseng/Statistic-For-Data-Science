#Sure, here is a Python code for finding the mode of a data set:

```python
import collections

def mode(data):
  """Finds the mode of a data set.

  Args:
    data: A list of data points.

  Returns:
    The mode of the data set.
  """

  counts = collections.Counter(data)
  return max(counts.keys(), key=counts.get)


if __name__ == "__main__":
  data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  print(mode(data))
```

#This code will print the mode of the data set, which is 2.

#Here is an example of how to use the code:

```python
data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mode = mode(data)
print(mode)
```

#This code will print the following output:

```
2
```
