In statistics, the mean is a measure of central tendency, calculated by adding up the values of all the observations in a dataset and dividing by the number of observations. It is also known as the arithmetic mean or simply the average.

The mean is a useful measure of central tendency because it is easy to calculate and understand. It can also be used to compare different datasets. However, the mean can be sensitive to outliers, which are data points that are very different from the rest of the dataset.

The formula for the mean is:

```
Mean = (Sum of all observations) / (Number of observations)
```

For example, the mean of the dataset {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is 3. This is because the sum of the observations is 15 and there are 5 observations.

The mean can be used to compare different datasets. For example, the mean income of a group of people can be compared to the mean income of another group of people. This can help to determine which group has a higher average income.

The mean can also be used to identify outliers. An outlier is a data point that is very different from the rest of the dataset. Outliers can skew the mean, so it is important to identify them and remove them from the dataset before calculating the mean.

The mean is a versatile measure of central tendency that can be used in a variety of statistical applications. It is a simple and easy-to-understand measure, but it is important to be aware of its limitations, such as its sensitivity to outliers.
