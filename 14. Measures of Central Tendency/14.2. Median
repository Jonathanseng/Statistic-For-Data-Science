1. It is the middle value is a sorted list of observations in a dataset.

2. In a dataset with an even number of observations, the median is the mean of the two observations in the middle.

3. The median is the same as the 50th Centile (C50)

4. The median is not influenced by the extreme observations in
a dataset.

For example, to calculate the median in a list of observations
i.e. 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4 , we sort the list to 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4 and the median is (2+3)/2 = 2.5 .
!"Distributions can be unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal according to the number of humps/peaks that they have.
