In statistics, a binomial distribution is a probability distribution that describes the likelihood of a certain number of successes in a sequence of independent experiments, each of which has only two possible outcomes: success or failure.

The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution, meaning that it can only take on a finite number of values. The probability of a success in each experiment is denoted by the symbol p, and the probability of a failure is denoted by the symbol q. The binomial distribution is defined by the following formula:

```
P(X = k) = nCk * p^k * q^(n-k)
```

where:

* X is the number of successes
* n is the number of trials
* C is the binomial coefficient
* p is the probability of success
* q is the probability of failure

The binomial distribution can be used to model a variety of phenomena, such as the number of heads that appear when a coin is flipped 10 times, the number of defective items in a batch of 100 items, or the number of people who respond "yes" to a survey question.

The binomial distribution is a powerful tool for analyzing data and making predictions. It is a simple distribution to understand and use, and it can be applied to a wide range of problems.

Here are some of the key properties of the binomial distribution:

* The mean of the binomial distribution is np.
* The variance of the binomial distribution is npq.
* The standard deviation of the binomial distribution is sqrt(npq).
* The binomial distribution is symmetric about the mean.
* The binomial distribution approaches a normal distribution as n increases.
