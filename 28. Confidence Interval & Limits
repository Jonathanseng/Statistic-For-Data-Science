Confidence Interval is given by the formula below:

where:
!" x is the sample mean
" z is the confidence value
!" s is the sample standard deviation !" n is the sample size
Most commonly used 95% confidence limits are equal to the sum of the sample mean and approx. 2 Standard errors.
In other words, if one takes repeated random samples from a population, 95% of the time the true population parameter would lie between the confidence limits.
The difference between the upper and lower bounds of these limits is called the Confidence interval.
