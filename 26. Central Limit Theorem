When the random sampling distribution of means is plotted, this distribution will become closer to a normal distribution as the size of the samples increases.
An infinite number of sample means will plot an ideal normal distribution.

This is true irrespective of the shape of the population distribution
from which the samples were drawn.
The population could be having a non-normal distribution but its random sampling distribution of means would still be normal.
