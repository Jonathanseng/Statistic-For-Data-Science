It is the probability of obtaining wrong results when the null hypothesis is true.
Most commonly, an alpha level (Î±) of .05 (5%) is considered for an experiment.
It is the threshold against which we measure the p-value.

!"If the p-value is less than or equal to alpha: we reject the null hypothesis
!"If the p-value is greater than alpha: we reject the alternative hypothesis
