The formula for standard deviation and variance used above was in context to a population rather than a sample of the population.
If the observation values instead were a random sample drawn

from a large parent population, then one uses n − 1 instead of n in the denominator of these formulae to calculate the sample standard deviation and sample variance.
This is known as Bessel’s correction.
For the example above, the sample standard deviation (s) is calculated as follows:
