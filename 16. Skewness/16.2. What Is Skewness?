Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a distribution. A distribution is symmetrical when its left and right side are mirror images. A distribution is asymmetrical when its left and right side are not mirror images.

There are three types of skewness:

* Positive skewness: The tail on the right side of the distribution is longer than the tail on the left side. This means that there are more values on the right side of the distribution than on the left side.
* Negative skewness: The tail on the left side of the distribution is longer than the tail on the right side. This means that there are more values on the left side of the distribution than on the right side.
* Zero skewness: The distribution is symmetrical. This means that there are an equal number of values on the left and right side of the distribution.

Skewness can be calculated using the following formula:

```
Skewness = (Mean - Median) / Standard Deviation
```

The mean is the average of the values in the distribution. The median is the middle value in the distribution. The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the values in the distribution are.

Skewness can be used to describe the shape of a distribution and to compare different distributions. For example, a distribution with positive skewness will have a longer right tail than a distribution with negative skewness. This means that there will be more values on the right side of the distribution with positive skewness than on the left side.

Skewness can also be used to identify outliers. Outliers are values that are very different from the rest of the values in the distribution. Outliers can skew the results of statistical analyses.

Skewness is an important concept in statistics. It can be used to describe the shape of a distribution, to compare different distributions, and to identify outliers.
