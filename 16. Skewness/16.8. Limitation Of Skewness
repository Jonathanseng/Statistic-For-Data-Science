Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a distribution. It is calculated by dividing the third moment of a distribution by the cube of its standard deviation.

However, skewness has some limitations.

* **It is sensitive to outliers.** Outliers are data points that are very different from the rest of the data. If there are outliers in a data set, they can skew the results of skewness calculations.

* **It is not always a good measure of the shape of a distribution.** For example, a distribution with a small amount of skewness can still be very asymmetric.

* **It is not always easy to interpret.** The interpretation of skewness can be difficult, especially for distributions that are not symmetrical.

Despite its limitations, skewness is a useful tool for describing the shape of a distribution. It is important to be aware of its limitations, however, so that you can interpret the results of skewness calculations correctly.

Here are some additional limitations of skewness:

* **It is not a robust measure.** Robust measures are not affected by outliers. Skewness is not robust, so it can be affected by outliers.

* **It is not a complete measure.** Skewness only measures the asymmetry of a distribution. It does not measure other aspects of the distribution, such as its kurtosis or its variance.

* **It is not always necessary.** Skewness is not always necessary to describe a distribution. In some cases, other measures, such as the median or the mode, may be more informative.

Overall, skewness is a useful tool for describing the shape of a distribution. However, it is important to be aware of its limitations before using it.
