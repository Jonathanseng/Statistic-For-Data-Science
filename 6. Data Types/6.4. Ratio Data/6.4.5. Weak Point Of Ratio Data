The main weak point of ratio data is that it does not have a true zero. This means that the absence of the variable is not represented by 0 on the scale. For example, a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius does not mean that there is no temperature.

This can be a problem when trying to compare ratio data to other types of data, such as ordinal or nominal data. For example, we cannot compare the temperature of 0 degrees Celsius to the number of people in a room.

Another weak point of ratio data is that it can be difficult to interpret. For example, a difference of 10 degrees Celsius between two temperatures does not necessarily mean that the difference in temperature is the same as a difference of 10 degrees Fahrenheit.

This can be a problem when trying to make inferences about ratio data. For example, we cannot say that a person who weighs 100 pounds is twice as heavy as a person who weighs 50 pounds.

Overall, ratio data is a valuable tool for understanding and analyzing data. However, it is important to be aware of the limitations of ratio data, such as the lack of a true zero and the difficulty of interpretation.
