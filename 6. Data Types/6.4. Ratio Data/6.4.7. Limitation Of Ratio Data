Here are some limitations of ratio data:

* **It is not always possible to obtain ratio data.** For example, it is not possible to measure the amount of love or happiness someone has.
* **Ratio data can be difficult to interpret.** For example, a difference of 10 degrees Celsius between two temperatures does not necessarily mean that the difference in temperature is the same as a difference of 10 degrees Fahrenheit.
* **Ratio data can be affected by outliers.** An outlier is a data point that is very different from the other data points in a set. Outliers can skew the results of statistical analyses.
* **Ratio data can be affected by measurement error.** Measurement error is the difference between the true value of a variable and the value that is actually measured. Measurement error can reduce the accuracy of statistical analyses.

Overall, ratio data is a valuable tool for understanding and analyzing data. However, it is important to be aware of the limitations of ratio data, such as the difficulty of interpretation and the potential for outliers and measurement error.
