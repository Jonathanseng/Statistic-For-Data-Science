Interval data is a type of data that can be ordered or ranked, and the differences between values are meaningful. For example, temperature measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit is interval data. The difference between 20 degrees Celsius and 30 degrees Celsius is the same as the difference between 30 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees Celsius.

Interval data is the third level of measurement in statistics, after nominal and ordinal data. Nominal data is the weakest type of data because it does not have any inherent order or ranking. Ordinal data is stronger than nominal data because it can be ordered or ranked, but the differences between values are not meaningful. Interval data is stronger than ordinal data because the differences between values are meaningful.

Interval data is often used in surveys and questionnaires. It can be used to measure things like satisfaction, preference, and opinion. Interval data can also be used to group data into categories. For example, a survey question that asks respondents to rank their favorite color is ordinal data. The categories of this data are "red," "blue," "green," and "yellow."

Interval data can be analyzed using a variety of statistical techniques, including frequency tables, bar charts, and histograms. These techniques can be used to describe the distribution of interval data and to identify patterns in the data.

Here are some examples of interval data:

* Temperature measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit
* Scores on a standardized test
* Ratings on a scale of 1 to 10
* Ordinal data that has been converted to interval data by assigning equal intervals to each category

Interval data can be a valuable tool for a variety of purposes. It is important to be aware of the limitations of interval data when using it to analyze data, but it can be a useful way to categorize, rank, and identify data.
