Nominal data is the most basic level of measurement. It is used to categorize data into mutually exclusive groups. The categories cannot be ordered or ranked in any meaningful way. For example, the data on the eye color of a group of people would be nominal data. The categories could be "blue," "green," "brown," and "other." There is no natural order to these categories, and it would not make sense to say that "blue" is greater than "green."

Nominal data is often used to identify or label variables. For example, you might use nominal data to identify the gender of a group of people. You could create two categories: "male" and "female." These categories are mutually exclusive, meaning that a person can only be in one category or the other. They are also non-ordered, meaning that there is no natural order to the categories.

Nominal data is the simplest level of measurement, but it can still be useful for statistical analysis. For example, you could use nominal data to create a frequency distribution, which shows how often each category occurs in the data. You could also use nominal data to create a bar graph, which is a visual representation of a frequency distribution.

Here are some examples of nominal data:

* **Eye color**
* **Gender**
* **Country of origin**
* **Favorite color**
* **Favorite sports team**
