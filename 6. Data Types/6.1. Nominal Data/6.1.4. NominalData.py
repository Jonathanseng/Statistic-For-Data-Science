import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'Eye Color': ['blue', 'green', 'brown', 'other']})

# Create a frequency distribution
df['Eye Color'].value_counts()

# Output
# blue    2
# green    1
# brown    1
# other    0

# This code creates a DataFrame with one column called 'Eye Color'. The column contains four values: 'blue', 'green', 'brown', and 'other'. The code then uses the 'value_counts()' method to create a frequency distribution of the data. The output shows that the most common eye color is blue, followed by green and brown. There is one person with an 'other' eye color.

# This is just a simple example of how Python can be used to work with nominal data. More complex analyses can be performed using more sophisticated techniques.
