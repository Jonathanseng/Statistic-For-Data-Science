import pandas as pd

# Create a list of ordinal data
ordinal_data = ["Very satisfied", "Satisfied", "Neutral", "Dissatisfied", "Very dissatisfied"]

# Create a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({"Ordinal Data": ordinal_data})

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)

# The output of the code is as follows:

#Ordinal Data
#0  Very satisfied
#1  Satisfied
#2  Neutral
#3  Dissatisfied
#4  Very dissatisfied

# This code creates a list of ordinal data and then creates a Pandas DataFrame from the list. The DataFrame can then be used to analyze the ordinal data.

#Here are some additional Python code examples for ordinal data:

#Frequency table: A frequency table is a table that shows the number of times each category in a set of data occurs. To create a frequency table for ordinal data, you can use the following code:

df["Ordinal Data"].value_counts()

# Bar chart: A bar chart is a graph that shows the frequency of each category in a set of data. To create a bar chart for ordinal data, you can use the following code:
df["Ordinal Data"].value_counts().plot(kind="bar")

# Histogram: A histogram is a graph that shows the distribution of data. To create a histogram for ordinal data, you can use the following code:
df["Ordinal Data"].hist()
