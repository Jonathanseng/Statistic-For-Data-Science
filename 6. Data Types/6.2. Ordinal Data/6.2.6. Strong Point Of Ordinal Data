The main strong point of ordinal data is that it can be ordered or ranked. This means that we can say that some data values are greater than or less than other data values. For example, we can say that a person who is "very satisfied" with a product is more satisfied than a person who is "satisfied."

This ability to order or rank data makes ordinal data more powerful than nominal data, which is the weakest type of data. Nominal data can only be categorized, but it cannot be ordered or ranked.

Here are some other strong points of ordinal data:

* Ordinal data is easier to collect than interval or ratio data.
* Ordinal data is more informative than nominal data.
* Ordinal data can be used to make inferences about the population from which it was collected.
* Ordinal data can be used to measure change over time.

Overall, ordinal data is a powerful type of data that can be used for a variety of purposes. It is important to be aware of the limitations of ordinal data, but it can be a valuable tool for data analysis.

Here are some examples of how ordinal data can be used:

* **Surveys:** Ordinal data is often collected through surveys. For example, a survey might ask respondents to identify their gender, age, or income level. This data can then be used to categorize respondents or to identify different groups of respondents.
* **Market research:** Ordinal data can be used to conduct market research. For example, a company might survey consumers to identify their favorite brand of toothpaste. This data can then be used to help the company make decisions about marketing and product development.
* **Social science research:** Ordinal data is often used in social science research. For example, a researcher might survey people to identify their political party affiliation. This data can then be used to study political behavior or to identify trends in public opinion.

Ordinal data is a useful type of data for some purposes. It is important to be aware of the limitations of ordinal data when using it to analyze data, but it can be a valuable tool for categorization, ranking, and identification.
