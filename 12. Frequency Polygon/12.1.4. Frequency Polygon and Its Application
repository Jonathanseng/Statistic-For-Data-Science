A frequency polygon is a line graph that shows the distribution of data. It is created by connecting the midpoints of the tops of the rectangles in a histogram.

Frequency polygons are used to visualize the distribution of data. They can be used to identify the shape of the distribution, the mean, the median, and the mode of the distribution. They can also be used to compare the distributions of two or more sets of data.

Here are some of the applications of frequency polygons:

* **Identifying the shape of the distribution:** The shape of the distribution can tell us a lot about the data. For example, a normal distribution is bell-shaped, with the mean, median, and mode all in the same place. A skewed distribution is not symmetrical, with the mean, median, and mode in different places.
* **Finding the mean, median, and mode:** The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency. The mean is the average of the data, the median is the middle value, and the mode is the most common value. Frequency polygons can be used to find these measures of central tendency.
* **Comparing the distributions of two or more sets of data:** Frequency polygons can be used to compare the distributions of two or more sets of data. This can be done by overlaying the frequency polygons on top of each other. By comparing the shapes of the distributions and the values of the measures of central tendency, we can learn about the similarities and differences between the data sets.
* **Identifying outliers:** Outliers are data points that are very different from the rest of the data. Frequency polygons can be used to identify outliers by looking for data points that are far away from the rest of the data.
* **Making predictions about future data:** Frequency polygons can be used to make predictions about future data. This is done by extrapolating the trend of the distribution into the future. For example, if the distribution is increasing, we can predict that the future data will also increase.

Frequency polygons are a versatile tool that can be used to visualize and analyze data. They are a valuable tool for anyone who works with data.
