Frequency polygons are a useful tool for visualizing the distribution of data. They have some strengths, including:

* **They can be used to visualize the shape of the distribution.** The shape of the distribution can tell us a lot about the data. For example, a normal distribution is bell-shaped, with the mean, median, and mode all in the same place. A skewed distribution is not symmetrical, with the mean, median, and mode in different places.
* **They can be used to find the mean, median, and mode.** The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency. The mean is the average of the data, the median is the middle value, and the mode is the most common value. Frequency polygons can be used to find these measures of central tendency.
* **They can be used to compare the distributions of two or more sets of data.** This can be done by overlaying the frequency polygons on top of each other. By comparing the shapes of the distributions and the values of the measures of central tendency, we can learn about the similarities and differences between the data sets.
* **They can be used to identify outliers.** Outliers are data points that are very different from the rest of the data. Frequency polygons can be used to identify outliers by looking for data points that are far away from the rest of the data.
* **They can be used to make predictions about future data.** Frequency polygons can be used to make predictions about future data. This is done by extrapolating the trend of the distribution into the future. For example, if the distribution is increasing, we can predict that the future data will also increase.

Overall, frequency polygons are a versatile tool that can be used to visualize and analyze data. They are a valuable tool for anyone who works with data.

Here are some additional strong points of frequency polygons:

* **They are easy to understand.** Frequency polygons are relatively easy to understand, even for people who are not familiar with statistics. This makes them a good tool for communicating data to a wide audience.
* **They are versatile.** Frequency polygons can be used to visualize a wide variety of data sets. This makes them a valuable tool for a variety of applications.
* **They are efficient.** Frequency polygons can be created relatively quickly and easily. This makes them a good choice for visualizing data sets that are constantly changing.

Despite these strengths, frequency polygons have some weaknesses, as mentioned above. However, overall, frequency polygons are a valuable tool for anyone who works with data.
