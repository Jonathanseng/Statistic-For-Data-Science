A frequency polygon is a line graph that shows the distribution of data. It is created by connecting the midpoints of the tops of the rectangles in a histogram.

To construct a frequency polygon, we need to know the following:

* The class intervals
* The frequencies of the classes

Once we have this information, we can proceed to construct the frequency polygon as follows:

1. On a horizontal axis, mark off the class intervals.
2. On a vertical axis, mark off the frequencies of the classes.
3. Plot a point at the midpoint of each class interval and at the corresponding frequency.
4. Connect the points with straight lines.

The resulting graph is a frequency polygon.

Frequency polygons are a useful tool for visualizing the distribution of data. They can be used to identify the shape of the distribution, the mean, the median, and the mode of the distribution. They can also be used to compare the distributions of two or more sets of data.

Here is an example of a frequency polygon:

This frequency polygon shows the distribution of the heights of 100 people. The horizontal axis shows the heights in inches, and the vertical axis shows the number of people with that height. The line graph shows that the heights are normally distributed, with a mean height of 68 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches.

Frequency polygons can be used to answer a variety of questions about data. For example, we can use a frequency polygon to:

* Identify the shape of the distribution
* Find the mean, median, and mode of the distribution
* Compare the distributions of two or more sets of data
* Identify outliers
* Make predictions about future data

Frequency polygons are a versatile tool that can be used to visualize and analyze data.
