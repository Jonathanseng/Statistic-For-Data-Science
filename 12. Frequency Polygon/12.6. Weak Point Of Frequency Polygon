Frequency polygons are a useful tool for visualizing the distribution of data. However, they have some weaknesses, including:

* **They can be difficult to interpret if the data is not normally distributed.** A normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve, with the mean, median, and mode all in the same place. If the data is not normally distributed, the frequency polygon may be difficult to interpret.
* **They can be misleading if the data is not representative of the population.** Frequency polygons are based on a sample of data. If the sample is not representative of the population, the frequency polygon may be misleading.
* **They can be time-consuming to create.** Frequency polygons can be time-consuming to create, especially for large data sets.

Overall, frequency polygons are a versatile tool that can be used to visualize and analyze data. However, it is important to be aware of their weaknesses before using them.

Here are some additional weak points of frequency polygons:

* **They can be misleading if the data is not continuous.** Frequency polygons are only appropriate for continuous data. If the data is discrete, the frequency polygon may be misleading.
* **They can be difficult to compare if the data sets have different ranges.** Frequency polygons are best used to compare data sets that have similar ranges. If the data sets have different ranges, the frequency polygons may be difficult to compare.

Despite these weaknesses, frequency polygons are a valuable tool for anyone who works with data. They are a versatile tool that can be used to visualize and analyze data.
