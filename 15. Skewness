Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable to its mean.
For a dataset with observations i.e. Y(1), Y(2),Y(3),...,Y(N) , the skewness is calculated as:



where:
1. Y Ì„ is the mean
2. s is the standard deviation
3. N is the number of observations

Skewness can be positive, zero, negative, or undefined. The skewness of a normal distribution is 0 .
