Descriptive statistics are a set of techniques used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. They provide a way to organize, summarize, and present the data in a meaningful and understandable manner. Here's how descriptive statistics work:

Measures of Central Tendency: Descriptive statistics often begin with measures of central tendency, which describe the typical or central value of a dataset. The most common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode.

Mean: The mean is calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of observations. It represents the average value of the data.
Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. It divides the dataset into two equal halves.
Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. A dataset can have no mode, one mode, or multiple modes.
Measures of Dispersion: Dispersion measures describe how spread out the data points are. They provide information about the variability or spread of the dataset.

Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It gives an idea of the total spread of the data.
Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It quantifies the spread of the dataset.
Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of how much the data deviates from the mean.
Frequency Distribution: Descriptive statistics can also involve creating frequency distributions, which organize the data into groups or intervals and count the number of observations falling into each group. Frequency distributions can be represented as histograms, bar charts, or tables.

Percentiles: Percentiles divide the dataset into 100 equal parts, with each part representing a percentage of the total data. Common percentiles include the 25th percentile (first quartile), 50th percentile (median), and 75th percentile (third quartile).

Correlation: Descriptive statistics can also be used to calculate correlation coefficients, such as the Pearson correlation coefficient. Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

Summary Statistics: Finally, descriptive statistics often include summary statistics that provide an overview of the dataset. These may include the minimum and maximum values, mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles.

Overall, descriptive statistics provide a way to understand the characteristics of a dataset, summarize the data, and identify patterns or trends. They help researchers, statisticians, and analysts make sense of the data and draw meaningful conclusions.
