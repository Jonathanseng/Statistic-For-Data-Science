Inferential statistics are a powerful tool for making inferences about a population based on a sample. They can be used to answer questions such as:

    Do two groups differ in their average height?
    Is there a relationship between smoking and lung cancer?
    Does taking a certain medication improve symptoms?

Inferential statistics can help you to make informed decisions about a population by providing you with a way to quantify the uncertainty of your results. For example, if you find that there is a statistically significant difference between the average height of two groups, you can be confident that the difference is not due to chance.

Here are some of the strong points of inferential statistics:

    They can be used to make inferences about a population based on a sample.
    They can be used to answer questions about the relationship between variables.
    They can be used to quantify the uncertainty of your results.
    They can be used to make informed decisions about a population.

However, it is important to note that inferential statistics are not without their limitations. One limitation is that they can only make inferences about the population from which the sample was drawn. For example, if you find that there is a statistically significant difference between the average height of two groups, you can only be confident that the difference is not due to chance if the sample was drawn randomly from the population.

Another limitation of inferential statistics is that they can be sensitive to the assumptions that are made about the data. For example, if you are using a t-test to compare the average height of two groups, you need to assume that the data is normally distributed. If the data is not normally distributed, the results of the t-test may not be accurate.

Overall, inferential statistics are a powerful tool for making inferences about a population based on a sample. However, it is important to be aware of the limitations of inferential statistics and to use them carefully.
