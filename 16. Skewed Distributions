It is a type of asymmetric frequency distribution where one tail is longer than the other tail.
These distributions can be named according to the tail of the curve. The positively (right) skewed curve has a longer tail on the right. The following curve shows the general relationship between the mean, median and mode for skewed distributions.

Note that the above relationship can fail:
1. in multimodal distributions
2. in distributions where one tail is long but the other is heavy
3. in discrete distributions where the areas to the left and right of the median are not equal
