In statistics, the range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a set of data. It is expressed in the same units as the data. For example, if the data set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, the range is 4 (5 - 1).

The range is a simple measure of variability, but it can be misleading if there are extreme values in the data set. For example, if the data set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1000}, the range is 995, but this does not accurately reflect the variability of the data.

Here is the formula for calculating the range:

```
Range = Highest value - Lowest value
```

The range is a useful measure of variability, but it is important to be aware of its limitations.

Here are some of the limitations of the range:

* The range is sensitive to outliers. Outliers are data points that are very different from the rest of the data. If there are outliers in the data set, the range will be larger than it would be if there were no outliers.
* The range does not take into account the distribution of the data. The range only considers the largest and smallest values in the data set. It does not consider the values in between.

Despite these limitations, the range is a useful measure of variability. It is a simple measure that can be easily calculated. It is also a good measure to use when there are not many data points in the data set.
