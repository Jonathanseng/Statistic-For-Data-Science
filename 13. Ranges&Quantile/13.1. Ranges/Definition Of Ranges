Range is the difference between the largest and smallest values of measurements in a dataset.
For example, in a dataset i.e. 1,2,4,3,67 , the range is 67 â€” 1 = 66.


In statistics, the range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a set of data. It is expressed in the same units as the data. For example, if the data set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, the range is 4 (5 - 1).

The range is a simple measure of variability, but it can be misleading if there are extreme values in the data set. For example, if the data set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1000}, the range is 995, but this does not accurately reflect the variability of the data.

Here is the formula for calculating the range:

Range = Highest value - Lowest value

The range is a useful measure of variability, but it is important to be aware of its limitations.
