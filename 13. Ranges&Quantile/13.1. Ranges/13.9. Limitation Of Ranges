The range is a simple measure of variability that can be easily calculated. It is also a good measure to use when there are not many data points in the data set.

Here are some of the use cases of ranges in statistics:

* **Identifying outliers.** Outliers are data points that are very different from the rest of the data. The range can be used to identify outliers by looking for data points that are far away from the rest of the data.
* **Comparing the variability of two or more data sets.** The range can be used to compare the variability of two or more data sets. For example, if the range of data set A is larger than the range of data set B, then data set A is more variable than data set B.
* **Making predictions about future data.** The range can be used to make predictions about future data. For example, if the range of a data set has been increasing over time, then we can predict that the range of the data set will continue to increase in the future.

Here are some additional use cases of ranges in statistics:

* **Quality control.** The range can be used to identify products that are not meeting quality standards. For example, if the range of weights of a product is too large, then it is likely that some of the products are underweight or overweight.
* **Investment analysis.** The range can be used to identify stocks that are overvalued or undervalued. For example, if the range of stock prices is too large, then it is likely that the stock is overvalued.
* **Risk assessment.** The range can be used to assess the risk of a particular investment or activity. For example, if the range of possible outcomes is large, then the risk of the investment or activity is also large.

Overall, the range is a versatile tool that can be used to visualize and analyze data in a variety of settings.
