One starts scientific research by defining a conjecture that states that the two groups being compared do not have any statistically significant difference between them.
This conjecture is called the Null Hypothesis (H0).
According to the Null Hypothesis, any differences between the two groups being analyzed are due to chance alone.
For example, if we plan to conduct a drug trial on cancer patients with one group receiving an experimental drug while the other receives a placebo (false treatment), the Null Hypothesis will be that there is no difference in the survival time in the two groups.
