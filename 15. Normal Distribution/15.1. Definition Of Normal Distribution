The Normal or Gaussian distribution is a symmetrical bell- shaped frequency distribution curve.
It can be represented using the following function:

where:
1. μ is the mean of the distribution (and also its median and mode)
2. σ is the standard deviation of the distribution
3. x is a random variable with a Gaussian distribution

Many real-world datasets form normal distributions. A few such examples are:
1. Height of a population
2. IQ of a population
3. The experiment of rolling a dice
