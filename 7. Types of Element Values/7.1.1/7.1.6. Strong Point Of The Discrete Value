Discrete values offer several strong points in statistics, making them valuable in various applications:

Clear and Interpretable Results: Discrete values provide distinct and well-defined categories or counts, which can lead to clear and interpretable results. This makes it easier to communicate findings and draw conclusions from the data analysis.

Easy to Collect and Measure: Discrete values are often obtained through straightforward counting or enumeration processes. They can be easily measured or observed, making data collection less complex compared to continuous variables that require precise measurements.

Suitable for Categorical Analysis: Discrete values are well-suited for categorical analysis and comparisons. They allow for the identification of patterns, relationships, and differences between different categories or groups. This makes them useful for studying survey responses, customer preferences, or any data that can be grouped into distinct categories.

Efficient for Memory and Storage: Discrete values are generally more memory-efficient and require less storage space compared to continuous values. This is particularly advantageous when working with large datasets, as discrete values can be represented using integer codes or categorical labels, minimizing memory usage.

Robust to Outliers: Discrete values are inherently robust to outliers since they are not affected by extreme values that fall outside the defined categories or counts. This can be advantageous in scenarios where extreme observations could disproportionately impact the analysis or interpretation.

Facilitate Probabilistic Modeling: Discrete values form the basis for various probabilistic models, such as the binomial distribution or the Poisson distribution. These models allow for the estimation of probabilities and likelihoods associated with different discrete events or counts. They are widely used in areas such as reliability analysis, quality control, and risk assessment.

Suitable for Decision-Making: Discrete values often align with decision-making processes where choices need to be made from a limited set of options. For example, discrete values can represent different product options, customer segments, or treatment choices in medical research. They provide a structured framework for decision-making and analysis.

Practical for Simulation Studies: Discrete values are frequently used in simulation studies, where discrete events or counts are simulated based on predefined probabilities or rules. This is particularly useful for modeling scenarios like queueing systems, population dynamics, or stochastic processes.

While discrete values have their strengths, it's essential to consider the specific characteristics and requirements of the data when selecting appropriate statistical methods and interpreting the results.
