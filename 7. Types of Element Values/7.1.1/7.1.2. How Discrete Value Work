In statistics, discrete values are distinct and separate, meaning they can only take on specific values within a given range. These values are often integers, but they can also be categorical variables. Discrete data differs from continuous data, which can take on any value within a range.

Discrete values are typically obtained through counting or enumeration. For example, the number of cars passing through a toll booth in a given hour, the number of students in a classroom, or the number of goals scored by a soccer team in a season are all examples of discrete data.

To work with discrete values statistically, various methods can be employed:

Data Collection: Discrete data is collected through observations or measurements. The values are typically recorded and organized in a dataset.

Data Description: Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize and describe the data. Common measures include the count (the total number of values), the mode (the most frequently occurring value), and measures of central tendency like the mean, median, and sometimes the mode.

Data Visualization: Discrete data can be represented visually using charts such as bar graphs or histograms. Bar graphs show the frequencies or counts of different discrete values, while histograms display the distribution of values across defined intervals or bins.

Probability Distribution: Discrete values often follow specific probability distributions, such as the binomial distribution or the Poisson distribution. These distributions provide a mathematical framework for understanding the likelihood of different values occurring and can be used for inference and prediction.

Hypothesis Testing: Statistical tests can be applied to determine if there are significant differences between groups or if observed patterns are likely due to chance. Examples include the chi-square test, which examines the association between categorical variables, and the t-test, which compares means between two groups.

Modeling and Analysis: Discrete values can be modeled using various statistical techniques, such as regression analysis or time series analysis. These models can help understand the relationships between variables, predict future values, or make decisions based on the data.

It's important to note that working with discrete values requires appropriate statistical methods and considerations, as they have distinct characteristics and assumptions compared to continuous data.
