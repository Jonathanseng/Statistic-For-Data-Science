These tests are used on the sample data that follows the following assumptions.

1. Normality: sample data should belong to a population that allows a normal distribution
2. Equal Variance: Each group's data should have approximetely equal variance
3. Independence: each group's data should be randomly and independently sampled from the population
4. Outliers: there should be no extreme outliers in the data

Examples of parametric tests are:
1. Linear regression
2. Logistic regression
3. t-test
4. Anova
5. Pearson ran correlation
