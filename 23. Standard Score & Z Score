The Standard score or Z-score measures how far an observation is away in terms of standard deviations from the mean.
Z-score of an observation can be positive or negative.

where:
!" μ is the mean of the population
!" σ is the standard deviation of the population
The process of calculating the Z-score from an observation’s value is called Standardizing or Normalizing.
